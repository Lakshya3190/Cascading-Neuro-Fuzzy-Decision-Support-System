# Cascading-Neuro-Fuzzy-Decision-Support-System
Herewith is proposed a cascading ANFIS DSS to predict the time to disengage protective overgarments in case of chemical spills.
The models takes the physical toll of protective overgarments into consideration and predicts the optimal time to take the protective
gear off. 

- No. of FIS: 3
- RMSE Error: 0.000028
- Training Epochs: 50

The Cascading descision tree is utilized to prevent the 'Cure of Dimensionality'. An inherent problem with complex fuzzy systems wherein 
computational efficiency decreases with increase in number of fuzzy rules.
